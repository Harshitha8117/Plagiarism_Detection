Plagiarism Detection System using NLP

⭐Overview

This project introduces an AI-powered plagiarism detection system that utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to identify content similarities at the document level. The system processes user-submitted documents and compares them against a database of reference files to determine the extent of copied or paraphrased content.

⭐Features

- Advanced NLP techniques for text analysis and comparison
- User-friendly web interface for document upload and result visualization
- Preprocessing module for text cleaning, tokenization, and normalization
- Reference database for storing preprocessed documents
- Plagiarism detection and similarity scoring

⭐Installation

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Harshitha8117/plagiarism-detection.git
2. Install required libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Flask application: python app.py

⭐Usage

1. Upload a document through the web interface
2. The system will preprocess the document and compare it against the reference database
3. View the plagiarism detection results, including highlighted text and similarity scores

⭐Future Enhancements

- Integration of advanced deep learning models like BERT or RoBERTa
- Support for multiple languages
- Real-time web crawling for dynamic content comparison
